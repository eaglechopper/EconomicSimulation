Biding/Asking optimisation
RULES FOR TRADING
- Highest bids will get processed first 
- Lowest asks will get processed first

A bider shall not accept any offer higher than the bid price
because the bider can create bids based on their cash reserve, if they accept a bid
higher than their bid it would break this mechanic

AGENT A has $50  market = {food $4 for 1 unit, wood $10 for 1 unit, jewelery $80 for 1 unit}
AGENT A Priorities are as follows;
- Food
- Wood
- Jewelery

//Function to generate offers
//lets say agenrt A needs 10 food and 4 units of wood, buy jewels in have money left over
GenerateOffers(market)
{
	canSpend = myRevenue
	market.createBid("food", 10)
	canSpend = canSpend - (10 * 4)//10 = food units, 4 = cost of food
	//canSpend = 10
	market.createBid("wood", 1) //can only afford 1 unit of wood
	//if the agent cant afford the essentials like food and water
	//we can get him to sell some goods
}
//TradeBooks

BUY FOOD                               SELL FOOD
Agent A  10 food @ $4                 Agent B 10 Food @  $7

//Possible algorithms to calculate economic behaviour

skill_progression = (talent, current_skill_level, interest_level, ??random_element??)


INTERESTS
- people have interests, each interest has a "influence" factor which dertermines
how influencial these interests have on their lives, and purchasing habits




//hard part
how to determine, how these interests change over time Long term vs Short term...


INSERTEST
- Base factor
- Influence factor
- Contact factor

interest_Level = function(base_factor, influence_factor, contact_factor)
